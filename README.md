For those who were not able to attend the LaTex/Beamer lunch session, here you find a LaTex template for scholarly articles. Further, you find a video link how you can install MikTex and Texmaker on your computer (Texmaker is the LaTex/Beamer editor I work in - you can also use another one) - it takes about 10 min to set it all up:

Installing MikTex on your computer (you need this before installing a LaTex editor like Texmaker):

IMPORTANT: As citation manager, I use BibDesk on Mac (https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io/), but you can also use Mendeley (https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop/) or others. Important is that you export the citations as .bib file and save it in the same folder as your LaTex article (i.e. your .tex file). In my template, the .bib file is called "bureaucrat_persuasion_model_biblio" and is called for in the bottom of the .tex file (under Bibbliograhy) with the command \bibliography{bureaucrat_persuasion_model_biblio}.
